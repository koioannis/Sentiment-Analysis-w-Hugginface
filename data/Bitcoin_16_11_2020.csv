jk4s30;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gcicto4;praveenbm5;1605545147.0;I get your point of view and we are on it.. But compared to multisig which allows for only 2 quasi parallel directions of freedom i.e. m and n in m of n keys arrangement, CoinVault affords us a lot of flexibility including prioritization of keys (CEO key over VP key over Custodian key and so on which can override lower priority keys during recovery when just one key is accessible/available for recovery), prioritization of combinations (CEO, VP and Custodian can override VP and custodian and so on when 2 or more keys are available for recovery), etc. All these are important differentiators for institutions and people responsible for securing a lot of Bitcoin. Given the number of levers available for fine tuning we thought we would first go ahead with ad-hoc solutions, gather intelligence regarding acceptable security models for various settings and then build a self serve solution based on those learnings than assuming a minimum viable security model ourselves and build a self serve solution based on those assumptions.On the other hand, a plug and play solution or a tailored solution hardly affect the value prop if we leave aside minor cost implications. If you are looking for a playground then we can definitely set it up for you.;1
jv4l6l;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gcics5h;Astropin;1605545126.0;that being said...remember that inflation still occurs. So $80,000 today is going to spend more like $56,000 in 10 years or so.;1

jv4ye9;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gcick4o;bestjaaa;1605545019.0;The concensus seams to be that bitcoin will go to at least 100k and take a om big role as a medium of storage and transactions. Wont this mean that the dollar will become worth very little compared to today, and therefore a LOT of big companies will suffer greatly finacially? I.e. Tesla?

jv9wxd;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gcichev;ZeitgeistGuy;1605544983.0;Well, yeah, nobody know the short term answer but at the same time you can apply common sense and realize that demand is greater than supply post halving with institutional fomo indicative of increasing value. Meanwhile addresses grow while exchanges hold less and less Bitcoin. A little off topic, but I consider any bitcoin held by an external party (holding keys so true ownership) as decentralized. The true value of Bitcoin lies in personal ownership. The only question for me is how much of bitcoin is/will be truly decentralized with so much 'big business' interest. Why would I add value to PayPal for example? It's fool's gold!;1

Having bought into BTC well before 2016, $16,000 is a healthy exit for me. Helps pay off my final mortgage and allows me to essentially rent my properties out without any mortgages to cover. BTC has only ever been a bit of fun for me, as I'd never risk me and my families future on a singular asset. It's been part of my financial strategy for the best part of 20 years along with having a portfolio that is mostly comprised of property and good old fashioned ETFs and stocks. I'm a software developer not a professional financial advisor so I prefer to pay for one to handle my investments in that respect.  However even I know to spread my risk which is why me and my wife have looked to build up properties for renting. Dividends and rental income are key to my early-ish (pre-50) retirement!;1

I not only got a really good deal (I was buying in late 2016 and early 2017) but I also got cash back from it all (well, Amazon credit, since it's an Amazon Prime credit card).  Eventually I paid off the card, and I ended up with more than a Bitcoin, long before it hit that ATH of $20,000.  Sadly the credit card company stopped letting me do it.So suggesting not to borrow to get Bitcoin is not necessarily good advice.  Learn the patterns of Bitcoin, and be ready to fuck up, but don't dismiss a good gamble when you see one.;1

jtfix6;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gci9t3c;steve_b;1605543697.0;For all practical purposes, it's basically an exchange-traded BTC fund with a 2-3% spread (meaning at any given moment, you'll sell something for 2-3% less than what you can buy it for).  You can't use it as a payment source when using Paypal to buy stuff online you need to convert it back to fiat on Paypal first.  You're far better off just setting up an account with an exchange if you're even half-serious about owning crypto for investment purposes, and it's completely useless if you want to buy stuff directly with BTC.Presumably Paypal is buying BTC behind the scenes to cover their customer's purchases - they'd be crazy not to, unless they're absolutely counting on the price dropping.  Given that they're taking a 2-3% cut on every transaction, there's really no reason for them not to - that's probably even a better deal than they're getting with other forms of payment, and the amount of legal & programming work they needed to implement this feature is even less than for their current operations.;1

Nope.

jtjkid;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gci8vt1;steve_b;1605543240.0;"I've owned BTC for many years now.  You're obviously new at this, and I assume you want to buy BTC in order to benefit from what you hope is its rising value, and not because you want to use it to engage in BTC transactions.If that's the case, then buying BTC through Paypal is probably good enough for now, as far as you're concerned.  Buying Paypal's ""Bitcoin"" is really the same as buying shares in a BTC-based exchange-traded fund.  You don't have access to the BTC directly, but you hold an asset that some other entity is promising will move in sync with BTC.  I'm not a Paypal hater, and it seems like they're reliable *enough*, so I would go ahead and do it, given that your ability to participate in a regular crypto exchange seems limited based on all your troubles (having a phone so bad that you can't take a picture of your ID seems like a pretty lame excuse, though.  Have you no friends with better cameras?).  As much as some people dislike Paypal, they sound like your most reliable bet.Just know that you don't actually own BTC, and you're beholden to PP's good graces to get your money back.  Ironically, you can't even use your Paypal BTC to buy stuff that accepts Paypal directly - you'll need to go onto the PP app or website, sell your BTC there (where it goes into your Paypal Cash Account), and then use the Cash Account.  At least, that's my experience (I bought $20 in BTC for the heck of it to check out the user experience) - I haven't seen my BTC funds show up in any PP payment screen when doing online shopping.Oh, as far as verification goes, if you already have a Paypal account, you don't need any.  They'll ask you for the last 4 digits of your SSN in order to buy, and if you want to sell, the first time you do so, they'll want your full SSN in order to report any gains or losses you incur to the IRS (or whatever other taxman exists in your country).";1

jus4yt;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gci8b6m;igadjeed;1605542959.0;Mining difficulty is not important. The mining target hash is important. Mining becomes more difficult as the target hash goes down, in the same way that a golf tournament is won by the golfer with the lowest score. People who don't understand golf invented a calculation for difficulty. Difficulty is inversely proportional to target  Miners compete in a guessing race to be the first to find a valid block header which has a hash smaller than the target  The target is adjusted to keep the block interval close to 10 minutes  Every 2016 blocks, the elapsed time for the previous 2016 blocks is compared to 20160 minutes. If the elapsed time was faster than 20160 minutes, the target is reduced, to slow the mining down. If the elapsed time was slower than 20160 minutes, the target is increased, to speed the mining up  The new target is calculated by multiplying the old target by the time ratio      new target = old target * elapsed time / 20160> dependent on the hash rateNot directly. The target adjustment is dependent on the elapsed time for the previous 2016 blocks. This time decreases if the hash rate increases;1

We are working on allowing wallet users to swap between themselves. We are familiar with [bisq.io](https://bisq.io), but this includes fiat which we cannot atomically swap. Some other useful applications though as the extension is backwards compatible with ethereum DApps, and we now also support Bitcoin DApps.;1

Chavez and Maduro have been in power for over two decades now. The ""upper class"" of back then have for the most part fled the country long ago, only to be replaced by the boliburgueses. No one here becomes rich without getting it in some way, shape or form from close ties to the government. Whether that is CADIVI fraud, siphoning money from PDVSA, etc, is what varies. So you're right in that they're likely against socialist policies, but they also have zero motive or incentive to replace the government because they are the ones that call themselves socialists.";1

Recently I discovered that I love programming and started to learn about web development so I can apply for a job on another country;4

jv2fc2;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gci2cqa;WocketMan0351;1605539949.0;I think the majority of people here can agree that bitcoin is the superior store of value:The amount of potential capital goods in the future is infinite. The amount of bitcoin is finite (but infinitely divisible) to represent said capital goods+human labor.So why bitcoin? Because bitcoin is the first form of value representation (money) that possesses these qualities:100% Immutability (can't be changed, limited issuance, disinflationary, permission-less, border-less, fully digital, fully verifiable, trustless.On top of that, there is no one in charge of bitcoin. Yet, humans have finally created a system that enforces an agreed upon set up rules and enforces the rules of money in a fully deterministic way without the need for a central authority: general consensus through proof of work algorithms.This is why bitcoin is revolutionary. It's the result of decades of work of trying to figure out how to solve the biggest problem for digital money: the double spend problem.However, what about a means of transactions?Do you guys think a separate chain will be the way, many chains, or do you think the lightning network (again, more than just bitcoin exists on the lightning network) will pave the way for a scalable means of transaction? I personally think that bitcoin on the lightning network, a payment layer, will be the future of transactions. Similar to how our current settlement layer in banks is a wire transfer, but we can interact and exchange value on layers above that, without the need for a wire transfer for every visa purchase, PayPal, square or Venmo/cash app transaction. However, the key part is that each transaction on these layers is enforceable by the settlement layer: wire transfers. Similar to how each lightning transaction is enforceable by an on chain transaction. Interested to see everyone's opinions here:);2

The majority of the US debt is owed to US citizens and corporations in the form of treasury bonds.Even calling it a debt is sort of absurd.  It's literally nothing like the debts you and I owe.  When you and I pay off a debt, it means we have more money to spare for other things next month.

jv4ye9;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gchwng4;TheGreatMuffin;1605536803.0;"> If the amount of transactions increase significantly and the fee rise a lot, will the bitcoin community consider increase the block size?The block size increase was considered for many years now (debates started to heat up from 2015, but it was a topic earlier than this, too). There was no consensus for it, and if there is no overwhelming, or at least ""rough"" consensus on a fundamental change in the protocol, status quo remains.  There are a lot of fundamental trade offs from simply increasing the block size, and those arguments you can read here: https://gist.github.com/chris-belcher/a8155df5051bb3e3aa96  Keep also in mind that we actually had an effective block size increase in 2017 (Segwit), although it's not something dramatic.  I don't think that a naive block size increase will never happen, but only at a point where there is consensus for it and the risks/trade offs seem reasonably for it (as vague as it sounds).  This doesn't have to do much with fees though. Blockspace is scarce by default, and scarce assets tend to rise in price, when there is demand for it. You can avoid high fees by using proper wallets which allow for custom fees, use bech32 addresses, learn how to estimate fees yourself (see f.ex [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/jkw0l5/transaction_stuck_read_this/)), make use of time periods with low transaction volume (weekends, nights) and/or simply lower your time preference for confirmations.";3

Not that they are very good at it, of course, but that's the goal.  And occasionally it works, as in the case of playgrounds and public parks, where folks can improve their lives in some way that doesn't harm others.;2

jurj5o;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gchtz67;Turil;1605535177.0;That's not what a zero sum game applies to. A zero-sum game is one where the accounting of the system (Bitcoin, or cars, or US$) is:X + Y = 0This means that X and Y have to be equal but opposite, as in 4 and -4.  For me to gain 4 monies you have to lose 4 monies.  Or cars.  Or chairs.  Or pincushions.A positive sum game is where the outcome is larger than zero, aka, where all parties increase in value.  This happens when the inputs are combined, as in a collaboration where two or more elements combine to generate something larger than either of the individual elements alone.  For example, I bring bricks, and you bring cement, we can build a strong and stable bridge that wouldn't exist if we were trying to build bridges independently.X + Y > 0The system that Bitcoin is, as a global, publicly run centralized accounting system is a positive sum result of many humans and computers working together to make something that otherwise couldn't exist.  But Bitcoin itself, as a currency, has to be zero sum for it to work as a competitive point scoring game (money).;1

Very difficult but still possible.In terms of security, both are strong and you will be safe with one or another, however, open or close source, the Trezor is hackable with physical access while Ledger isn’t.;1

jv4ye9;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gchqhub;TheGreatMuffin;1605532870.0;> If I wanted to hold it for the shorter term, say 1-2 years, do you think keeping it on a trading app will be okay?  Well, you are seeing how much they let you jump through the hoops just to use your own money, so imagine what happens if their T&C's change, or they get hacked, or have financial difficulties, or regulations change and they're required to get more KYC data from you or refuse to let you cash out because of reasons...  It's strongly discouraged to keep bitcoin with a third party, and for good reasons.  Now, if you never ever had your own bitcoin wallet and don't know how they function, don't rush heads over heels to withdraw your bitcoin. Take your time. But you absolutely should do it.  F.ex like this: First, pick a wallet here: https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/recommended-wallets.html   Install and create a new wallet. **Write down on paper the words it gives you, and never store them online**. Send a small amount of funds into this new wallet. Delete the wallet. Don't worry, if you still have the words, you shouldn't have any problems re-importing it and see your coins still be safe. Re-import your written words into your wallet.  Congratulations, now you've learned how send, backup and store your private keys. It's really not rocket science :)  That all said: can you actually withdraw bitcoin from Wealthsimple?;3

jurjca;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gchq99f;macadamian;1605532697.0;Venezuela has a large political movement that is primarily socialist, it’s supported by the poor because they receive health care and education. Or at least they did before the price of oil crashed and the US blocked them off from outside financing. Venezuela’s upper classes are vehemently against socialist policies, yet they don’t have the numbers to democratically replace their government. You’re left with a stalemate between the rich and the poor. It’s interesting that in the US you never really get the full picture.;1

jv5ms3;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gchpynf;Crypto-Guide;1605532481.0;The main security difference with the ColdCard is that you can operate it in a permanently air-gapped way and don't ever need to use any vendor supplied software. The ColdCard is also less forgiving in that if you forget your PIN, there is no factory reset, the device is bricked after too many wrong attempts. The Nano X also supports U2F both wired and Bluetooth so can increase the security of your other online logins that support it.Ledger is a solid device, with a solid team and track record. The concerns that folk have at the moment are mostly around their marketing database getting leaked earlier this year. (Which has resulted in many ledger customers receiving tonnes of targeting phishing messages)IMO, the Nano X is still the best mobile experience for any wallet on the market, especially if you want to be mobile-only.;3
jv5ms3;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gchpxj6;TheGreatMuffin;1605532457.0;"> So right now I use Blockfolio to track what I’ve got in different places but it involves manually entering transactions. You can avoid doing this manually by using an app that lets you import your xpub into it. An xpub is something that all your addresses in your wallet are generated from. So if you import it into a ""watch only"" wallet, it will be able to display you all the transactions into your wallet automatically.  **Be aware that this is horrible for your privacy though. You are essentially giving away all your incoming transactions data to a third party FOREVER, without knowing how this data is going to be used.** This third party won't be able to steal any of your funds, so giving the xpub away is safe in this regard, but I would strongly discourage from doing this in the first place, except you have a very good reason to do so.";2

jv4ye9;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gchpq77;mikesautodiagnostics;1605532307.0;I’m new and dumb AF. A smart friend told me a few months ago that I should invest in Bitcoin. Last week he was talking about how much it has risen since we last talked about it. He told me to still invest, that I still have time to get in, before I’m buying in at the peak. Soooo me being dumb as fuck and not knowing anything about Bitcoin, decided I was going to add money onto my trade account (Wealthsimple) and buy crypto there, before I realized I don’t actually own the Bitcoin that I pay for. On Wealthsimple, they hold your money for 5 business days before you can spend it on crypto, so the date I can use the money would be the 19th. Then if I want to withdraw it, it would be another 10 or 15 days, so into December. If I wanted to hold it for the shorter term, say 1-2 years, do you think keeping it on a trading app will be okay? I don’t want to wait to long before buying in because there has been a lot of hype the last week about it. I know now about the whole not your keys, not your coin, but I’m more so thinking of this as a short term investment, rather than a long term. Aaannnnndddddd let the roasting begin.;2

jv4ye9;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gchpc5m;TheGreatMuffin;1605532013.0;The site looks shady af, nobody heard about it yet, and you shouldn't be trading in the first place. Reasons:   You *will* be competing with market participants that are much better (more informed, access to more data, better emotional state, larger bankroll, better tech etc etc). In order to make money in trading, you have to beat your opponents, AND taxes, AND the trading fees, AND your own self (discipline).  So you need to ask yourself: what are you doing better than the other participants in the market? If you can't answer this question clearly, you shouldn't be trading. Or if you still really want to, treat it like a gambling hobby (nothing wrong with that, but be clear that it's just gambling with negative odds for your side). And you have to use reputable sites with a long standing history, otherwise you are adding massive risks to your trading (from exist scams, exchange going busto, getting hacked, personal information leaked and so on).;4

jurjca;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gchmlar;sph44;1605529854.0;Ok, but space travel is very expensive. It is not at all clear that mining asteroids in the future (at least in our lifetimes) would even substantially increase the world supply, or reduce the market value. You’re talking about extremely costly extraction & logistics, and *very restricted quantities* of total gross weight that a spacecraft could carry back to earth. Every ounce of weight matters on spacecraft. I doubt it would be cost effective to transport ore, so they would probably have to figure out a way to burn it off in space to extract mostly pure gold in order to transport it.Silver would not be affected by that AFAICS.  There is no way it would be cost effective ti transport silver from space, even if they figured out how to mine it & process it in space to extract pure silver.;1

ju5esf;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gchk4zm;raywilliamjohnsoncel;1605527673.0;This is how I understand the dust attack (but I might be wrong, correct me if that's the case):Address that has dust on it is already watched and potentially deanonimized. Even if you had money on this address and send it somewhere, it is watched if there is dust or not since bitcoin blockchain is transparent. So dust attack or not, it doesn't matter, attacker can watch you either way.The problem is when your wallet has multiple addresses. If you make a payment, your wallet app will join coins from multiple addresses and it can include the attacked address even if there is nothing besides the dust. This will prove to the attacker that other addresses that are yours as well. This can lead into further deanonimization.Best thing would be if you send btc from this attacked address to exchange individually (if there's any) and don't join it with other addresses on your wallet. Not sure if ledger supports it or not.EDIT: I might have used the term wallet and address a bit weirdly. By wallet I mean multiple btc wallets that are grouped and by address I mean wallet. Confusing I know, but hopefully you get me.;2

It's critical to not have the blockchain grow too fast, since that would mean it would become infeasible for people to host their own validating node, which would ultimately lead to a centralization of nodes.One of the main attack vectors on bitcoin is therefore spamming the network with low miner fee transactions in order to grow the blockchain to such an extent, that node centralization becomes an issue.

Credit cards, mortgages, car payments, insurance, pensions, salaries... Even you must have a bank account just to simply participate in society.

Don’t be delusional in believing that owning some crypto makes you a rebel, or owning Monero will change any bloody thing... it won’t, not for a long time. And yes, I do “own” it. There’s legal consumer protection, at least here in Europe. That means my savings are backed by the countries central bank, that means if the bank topples, the government can step in. With crypto there is none. If a bank can legally hold crypto, and allow its platform for payments with crypto, the central banks must cover that asset. Anyway...;3

jv3200;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gchbtbg;dont-listentome;1605518932.0;> People say it’s not 100% private aswell.That's correct. Also, there's really no such thing as 100% anonymous or private transactions. Anonymity is a spectrum. There are certain things you can do to increase your anonymity, and there are things that will lower your privacy. There is one thing we can assert though, which is that the data stored in bitcoin's blockchain doesn't include any personal identification. However, that doesn't mean that an address can't be linked to a person through other means.> Do people use it as a form of Payment enough?Of course, but the fact is that the base layer of bitcoin isn't meant to be used for micro transactions. Think of it as a form of spam prevention. There is a second layer called the Lightning network, which exchanges bitcoin IOU's without writing them to the chain. They are basically instant transactions, but its security model is a lot more complex than the base layer's security model.;1

So if all mining was done with 16.5 TH/s rigs, there would be 7,575,757 (125,000,000 / 16.5) of them.    Each day 900 BTC is mined, X $16,200 BTC/USD = 14,580,000 earned by miners each day.  Divide that by 7,575,757 of the souped up S9 units, and the revenue per unit is $1.93 per day, or X 30 = $57.74 per month per S9. X 16 units = $923 per month.  That's just shy of the $1,000 per month you were hoping for.Unfortunately, the problem is the bitcoin hashrate has not yet caught up with the price rally -- but historically this happens regularly, hashrate lags price by several months.But with a 70% rally over several months, expect maybe a 40% to 70% hashrate increase (or more) to occur within a few months.So while you might make that $923 for the first month or two, it will certainly drop, perhaps to $600 or less by those future months. With even less thereafter.  How much less?  Nobody knows.Most people could not do what you are looking at doing.   Today using that 16.5 TH/s rig, your ""miner's equilibrium"" on electricity is ~$0.05 per kWh.  Paying anything less than $0.05 per kWh (not accounting for capital expenditure) is profit.  Well, your cost per kWh is $0.00, as you describe it.However, how likely is it you will be able to draw 25 kW (16 X 1.4kW X 1.10 (10% margin)) -- assuming your rigs draw 1.4kW + 10% each?   And 25 kW throws off way more heat than your 30,000 BTU A/C could hope to offset.Free electricity sounds great for mining, but appears you're already going to be hitting the limits well before adding even a few more machines, nonetheless 12 more.";2
