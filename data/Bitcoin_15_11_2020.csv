jmiko9;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gceuezb;andytoshi;1605465285.0;I don't think that you're computing the right probabilites, but to be honest, I don't have a good reason why. This seems like one of those situations where the choosing the right things to condition on is both subtle and critical.So rather than analyzing your reasoning, I just [implemented my program](https://gist.github.com/apoelstra/3c5957707bea4b0b00ddf2f8d7801395) to collide a variant of siphash from the Rust standard library. This is a 64 bit hash so naively ought to take 2^32 serial work. Instead I spawn 1024 threads and do it in a bit over 2^22 work.I think it's expected to work 1/e of the time, and indeed it seems to work every couple times that I try it (each attempt is ~90 seconds on my laptop).;1
jujcza;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gceuef8;LucSr;1605465276.0;For #2, people shall realize that the media-of-exchange is to protect the store-of-value ultimately.  If not, countries can force the custodial centralization and put insane capital gain tax on people to nullify the store-of-value purpose.&#x200BI think there is some conflict of interest for #2 because Fidelity, being a major financial institution, can enjoy the benefit of bitcoin already even bitcoin can be only used by central banks, major financial institutions, super wealthy guys ...etc.  Bitcoin would result in a bright future for countries who hate being bullied by USA's irresponsible USD but this does not necessarily mean a bright future for countries’ average citizens.;1

juq1k5;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gceuc3q;TheGreatMuffin;1605465242.0;">Bitcoin is a volunteer project those that contribute to the code can be easily compromised and intentionally push a bug that will undermine bitcoinI upvoted your post but this part is really misleading.  It's true that very few people (relatively to the world's population, or even the bitcoin space itself) understand the code deeply. However, it's not very easy to get any kind of malicious code into it, especially if it has the potential to cause really nasty (consensus) bugs.  Usually, every line of code is discussed, peer reviewed, tested and again reviewed, discussed and so on. So even if one or more developers were compromised, it wouldn't make it easy to inject malicious code into bitcoin. Keep in mind, the last major release of Bitcoin Core listed over 100 developers as contributors, so we're not really talking about ""few people"" here either. But even then, it's up to the individual user to decide of they want to run this code or not. So even if the majority of people probably run whatever code the Bitcoin Core repo publishes, there are also lots of critical eyes on it, and this serves as yet another layer of ""checks and balances"".  Here is a great article explaining how those checks and balances work: https://blog.lopp.net/who-controls-bitcoin-core-/";1

Ironically, current models that predict price just predict infinite price and justify this with ""the dollar will hyperinflate"" or ""the model will fail eventually"".Generally speaking, halvings have price impact because newly mined bitcoin represent the net money inflow (read net real world buying power) needed to enter the system to keep the current price.

juo2fp;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gcej2wz;Perringer;1605459172.0;The other part of the price equation is the demand for bitcoin, which, obviously, can't be pre-determined by the algorithm that controls bitcoin's programmed inflation reduction to zero.Part of the nature of bitcoin's volatility is precisely because the supply can not be varied, but the demand can vary wildly. The parabolic peaks and crashes that seem to be occurring on a near regular 4 year cycle are a result of the demand side of the equation. It's a price discovery every time after the halvings.While there's nothing to guarantee this current cycle will have a similar boom/bust, current events and social sentiment seem to be lining up for it to happen again, as the advantages of bitcoin become more clear to a larger set of groups. The factor that ultimately begins to limit the volatility of bitcoin isn't the supply rate, but the price vs demand. As bitcoin's price inflates, large monetary swings become a lower percentage of bitcoin's value, which will dampen the volatility, and help to regulate the demand.;1

Again, the whole quantum computer hacking argument is irrational. BTC and cryptos like it are, by far, the most secure payment systems on the planet so if someone put the time, money, and effort into building a quantum computer for malicious intent, for them to set their sites on bitcoin and not, let’s say, enemy nations defense systems or information databases, then bitcoin would have to be worth it i.e. mass adopted. In which case, any successful attack on bitcoin would destroy public trust in not only bitcoin but all digital currencies and traditional rails and financial infrastructure that you, as a gold owner, would depend on to actually liquidate your gold. Since digital currency will be the only currency that exist in the future(look up central bank digital currencies)It would cause societal collapse and no one actually wants that. Like I said before, gold’s only advantage is in a cataclysmic event but even that is a far stretch. Are you really going to be hauling your gold around after society has collapsed when food and water and shelter are much more valuable and looters and unorganized militias are roaming around raiding people for resources? It only works if you have your own private self-sustained bunker, and your own guerrilla militia to defend it.

The share of this category when combined with Node management would be 120 or 37%)Financial infrastructure and LiFi (a term supposedly introduced in the Lightning Labs newsletter) is the second prevailing segment (49 or 15%). Yes, we are building a financial system first of all!Further on, substantial project activity is observed in wallet and gaming segments (90 or 28%) indicating that consumer use cases are dominating the minds of developersEarning, stacking and tipping are very popular use cases too, though merchant-focused services did not see much innovation in 2020, while experiments with social apps have remained steady.The database is here free to access, and a Google Spread Sheet version export is also available upon request.;1

jun5ad;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gcecqxu;johnwick3;1605455563.0;The pin on the trezor is not the same as a passphrase that he references.  The pin on a trezor is exclusive to your trezor device.  If anyone had your 12 words, they could take your Bitcoin regardless if your trezor was present or not.What he's referencing is the fact that, we all have an optional word we can tack on when creating a seed, and in your example, would basically be a 13th 'word' except you choose what it is.I'm assuming you didn't create that extra word, so assuming you have correctly written down your 12 word seed phrase, your trezor can be lit on fire and melted into oblivion and you would still be able to access your BTC in 15 or 20 years, as you put it, so long as you had that 12 word seed phrase.And again, that's assuming you didn't add a passphrase onto your seed.  The trezor pin is NOT the same thing at all.  The trezor pin is 100% exclusive to that particular device.  It isn't kept on the blockchain and it isn't kept on trezor's servers.  It's only on that device.  Your seed words are completely independent of your trezor pin.If you have correctly documented your seed phrase, trezor could be completely dead and gone in 20 years, and your Bitcoin would still be likely just fine, so long as you didn't expose it to anyone.;4

Uh, no sir - they're simply creating a scenario in which fewer people in their society have access to Gold just like the US did in the 1930's, which permits them to devalue their currency whenever they want.Edit:  The downvotes on this issue always amuse me - do people really think the single party autocratic CCP are going to be somehow splendid on the issue of currency manipulation should they gain control of the world's reserve currency?

jueq15;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gce7wuf;gunshotaftermath;1605452570.0;It's only a currency if it's more widely accepted. That's the issue right now, the volatility, pricing, and speed makes it hard to use.A merchant at a store would have to list Satoshis, which might fluctuate day to day, as price tags. Or price it at a currency rate against USD which is even more volatile. At checkout, you would have to wait between three to fifteen minutes for the transfer to complete before the customer can take their purchase. If there's any tech problems like the internet going down, server going down, there's no backup system. And finally, consumer trust is hard to earn. People who say Bitcoin is like Fiat forget that the USD has the American government backing it. This means when you put your USD in a bank and they get hacked, you lose nothing. With Bitcoin, you are your only line of defense.Finally, adoption requires a lot more than just curiosity. Right now most stores can technically accept Gold or the Euro or the Yen, but they have no reason to. Merchants only care about profit. If Bitcoin has no fees vs Credit cards, great, but even that's not the case, and again, credit cards offer layers of consumer and merchant protections. Not saying that Bitcoin CANT one day be a widespread currency, but realistically speaking the tech isn't there yet for widespread adoption and won't be for decades. Personally I'm hodling for the store of value, but until these three fundamental issues are solved, it isn't a viable currency yet.;1

juk43k;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gce77fb;schwagnificent;1605452101.0;To say that a hardware wallet has never been hacked and no one has ever lost money with a hardware wallet is dishonest.When an exchange gets hacked, it is big news because tens of thousands are exposed at once.  Every time someone misplaces their seedphrase, or someone steals it or hacks into where they have it stored and accesses it, people have lost money.But in the latter case, no one hears about it except in rare circumstances.  It’s not newsworthy.  Now most exchanges, I would not trust any significant amount of money with them.  Coinbase is a reputable business that relies on maintaining security to keep its reputation, and I’m sure there are others who are equally reputable.  The likelihood of your money disappearing from coinbase is extremely low.  Obviously can never be zero.  The likelihood of the average person not properly securing their own passphrase is also not zero.  There are plenty of individual examples of “lost bitcoin”, just like there are examples of exchange hacks where people lost money.  IF you are 100% confident in your own ability to securely store your passphrase so that you can always access it and no one else could ever access it, then that’s great.  A hardware wallet is probably the best option for you.  I believe the majority of people don’t feel that way.  For them, a reputable exchange like coinbase is probably the safest available of all the imperfect options.;7

I was being somewhat satirical but maybe it came across wrong. Love reading about the history of economy. I was commenting on a more general sense in a larger timeline (because the poster was asking what the riches will do). The way the economy is implemented has changed over time, but the basis of it will remain the same. Millions don’t understand it (or care for it) and a few control it.  (Think Thomas Piketty.)The “riches/elites” won’t let their currencies or equities “collapse.” They’ll redefine and implement the new economy, likely while adopting the new technology. It’s super interesting how this will play out though. (Think the current discussions on stablecoins, JPMorgan, and how the govt will respond.)Exciting time to be alive.;1

So everyone that is owed $’s will always get them in nominal terms. The only question is what will those $’s be worth. If the Fed is having to print trillions every year to cover exponentially increasing federal liabilities the value of each individual $ will decline. It’s a soft default instead of a hard default.Edit: this isn’t as straight forward as it seems though. Currencies are all relative to one another and every country in the world that can is going to be devaluing its currency at the same time the US is. So the USD exchange rate vs the euro or yen for example may stay relatively stable during this process (as it has up until this point despite massive deficit spending and monetization) but the value of the $ vs hard assets such as real estate, gold, Bitcoin, and stocks will decline.

julg5l;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gce2w9v;PatriotCrypto905;1605448996.0;PayPal sells paper bitcoin.  Soon many others big companys like that will as well. This will destroy its scarcity after the bull run then usdt will get found guilty, when the government is rdy and it will collapse the whole space then government and wall street will have already pulled out all the money and will become even bigger multi millionaires/billionaires/trillionaires. Meanwhile all the bag holders and all the people that bought bitcoin once again will lose all their money. The signs are all there paper bitcoin is being sold already. The government is implementing fractional reserve bitcoin soon. If you’re even paying attention to the news you will notice that all the big exchanges are being arrested or taken down or shut down because those were the biggest players that actually manipulated the market that had enough bitcoin to actually matter. By the way I’m not defending them they did a lot of bad things but the people who are going to take over now are going to be a lot worse matter fact you’ll probably miss the exchanges after the USA or shadow government “regulates” bitcoin. leverage/margin trading is also a form of control look how oil crashed to nothing that time even though it’s so scarce... Futures is just a way so the rich can manipulate the market and hold control at all times. To be honest I think shorting the market should be illegal because if you think about it it gives people the ability to mess with the enterprise and tank it on purpose so they can make money. For instant imagine a new airline is going to review a new plane that runs on corn. It’s first test flight is soon and people bought loads of stock for this “innovation” (like bitcoin) then out of no where the plane gets blown up or crashes and it took 12 years to build. Presumably it would take another 12 years to build. Do you think people are going to keep their money in that stock? Probably not. Do you think after the plane explodes or fails whether it was on purpose or not that the stock is going to skyrocket? I wouldn’t count on it. Now let’s just say for craps and giggles that the plane doesn’t get blown up on purpose and somebody opened up $1 million short the next day with a huge leverage. Basically what I’m trying to say is shorting should be illegal and has little place significance to help anyone. They say over 80% (def low balling) of the people who leverage trade lose all their money. If that’s the truth then that means shorting even has less of a positive impact on the crypto space as a whole. Wasn’t the point of bitcoin was to re-distribute the wealth and give the poor a chance to actually have a future? I don’t care what everyone says but we are losing this battle and letting the government take over the crypto space and it should never of happened. My prediction is that so, we will probably see the bull run and we probably will have great gains. I do believe that the rich and elite do not want to miss on this chance. That’s why they’re buying like crazy but in the end whether it’s China’s 51% attack that’s pending to happen or they just simply want control of btc. The government will paper bitcoin and fractual reserve lend it so after this all time high you will never see gains like this again. Look at the YouTube space being suppressed on a daily basis. They are just waiting for the bull run to go by and they don’t want any more people to buy in the space out of the  60 million people whom already live in the USA that owns bitcoin and alt coins.This will be short-lived so enjoy it while it last because if you think we’re going to see $1 million bitcoin and then a $10 million bitcoin and $100 million dollar bitcoin and it will change your life. I doubt it. . . The 1% which is now smaller that owns 99% of the money definitely doesn’t want you to be joining the ranks that’s for sure. Also if we’re going to have a constructive argument and you’re going to comment say something, I hope it has something to back it up. I’m sick of people commenting saying oh that won’t happen. A lot of you people are in denial. I have been in the crypto space since after the first bull run and bitcoin bought my first house and changed my life substantially, I just wish we could preserve that same idea and scarcity. I want to see everybody prosper and have the life that makes them happy. Ensuring our one good horse (bitcoin) against financial tyranny should be our main goal. Last thing I’d like to mention is look at all the money that’s been printed since coronavirus has started if you don’t think some of that money privately bought bitcoin over the counter than your crazy.  The government took down the silk road along time ago and auctioned off all the bitcoin and only got like $60 million for it. Had they kept that same bitcoin today they would’ve already had $500 billion. Don’t think the government doesn’t know how it all works now and how to manipulate it.It was a fact that two years ago they brought together a meeting called the round table where they brought some of the biggest influential people, exchanges, large btc holders, and elite. From there after that meeting we had the craziest crash down to 3.5 K and then we went completely up all the way to where we are now. Do you think the government would pull the plug on usd tether with all their money in there, he’ll no.

judwkc;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gce23ft;almkglor;1605448382.0;"That's a significantly better system for the purpose of creating a whitelist for Bitcoins.A way to get around this would be to run a mining pool, and add pointless self-paying transactions, paying from non-official addresses to new non-official addresses.  Those transactions would still end up paying fees, and that is how you launder the funds back into legitimate addresses for your mining pool: the fee deducted from the self-paying transactions is earned by your mining pool, and that is now ""clean"", having come from mining.Thus, the government would additionally have to require that mining pools within their jurisdiction can only accept transactions from and to official addresses.This creates friction when people within this jurisdiction need to trade with people outside this jurisdiction (they have to regularly receive funds that are not in the government records, since people outside their jurisdiction would not really need to register with *them*), hurting trade and the economy within the jurisdiction of that government.  Since transactions outside their jurisdiction still exist (unless you are postulating a single global government?), most mining pools operating within the jurisdiction of that government would be operating at a loss compared to those outside their jurisdiction (those outside their jurisdiction can confirm even non-official-address transactions, those inside the jurisdiction can only confirm official-address transactions), which the government would have to continuously subsidize, or else it will lose control of mining as mining pools inside their jurisdiction collapse in competition with those outside their jurisdiction.  Without any mining pools of their own (that they have to continuously subsidize!), this leads to capital flight --- mining pools outside their jurisdiction earn the fees of official-address-to-official-address transactions, so that official funds slowly deplete due to transaction fees, leading to economic collapse of that government.This ties in with the censorship resistance of Bitcoin: it is an economic resistance, people who want to make transactions deemed ""illegal"" can bump up their transaction fees.  Censoring miners give up the fees of transactions deemed illegal, but non-censoring miners can earn those fees, and non-censoring miners thereby get an advantage in mining competition.Note that Bitcoin's censorship resistance only really works as long as no entity can control >50% hashpower.  This implies that Bitcoin ***cannot*** resist a **global** government, as such a government would be capable of controlling 100% hashpower, which is much greater than 50%.  The hope is that a government that can cover nearly 50% of the governable populace of the world would be too unwieldy to exist as a single coherent entity, so that there will always be competition.  In a world where there is a monolithic global government that allows no resistance, your scenario would work.  But if there is more than one government, then it is possible to still resist them.";1

It's very unusual for the central bank to set the reserve requirement to zero.  Our debt is out of control, much worse than ever before.  Soon, we will have negative interest rates.  You will have to pay to keep money in a bank and to own US Treasury bonds.  In other words, rather than bonds paying you, you will pay to own bonds.  What country and what people in their right minds will buy them?  I think you're going to be shocked over the next ten years.  Still, all of this is beside the point.  Just in case the shit hits the fan, the elite have to have a way to move their value across borders.  People have been trying to shove gold up their asses but it's not working out well so far.;1

jueq15;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gcdwz2f;pitchbend;1605445341.0;">Interesting, why is the difficulty and amount of energy needed to maintain bitcoin transactions an advantage?Because it is directly proportional to the security of the network. In order to attack the network or brute force it's transactions you'll need 80megawatts of electricity which is very very difficult even for an entire country. This difficulty in attacking the network and generating bitcoins is at the core of it's store of value capabilities.Gold is a good store of value not because it's pretty or some bullshit but because like diamonds or bitcoins it takes a massive amount of power and electricity to create/extract it. If gold grew on trees if wouldn't be so expensive and a store of value.By the way this amount of energy is not ""needed"" to maintain the network. The difficulty and amount of energy is a result of the success of bitcoin. The higher the price the more competition it creates for securing and minting bitcoins, the more secure the network the higher it's value proposition which creates the positive feedback loop that brought bitcoin price and processing power to where it is now.>What happens when the difficulty and cost to mine new bitcoins is higher than the value of bitcoin?Difficulty and cost to mine is elastic it adjusts every two weeks upwards or downwards it's always in equilibrium with price.";1

jukivy;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gcduxxg;Crypto-Guide;1605444168.0;Basically your 24 word seed is a kind of starting point to a deterministic (so it always produces the same result) series of extremely large numbers. These numbers allow you to generate a corresponding Bitcoin address. It's more like writing down and sharing a physical location where something is hidden in that the physical location already existed before you decided to hide something there. (So it's nothing like centralised online accounts where you have to register online before use)I talk about it a bit more here https://youtu.be/X3_t6wO2f5MIt's an odd concept if you are starting out but basically nothing is stored online in anyone's software, all the keys are stored locally in your Ledger Nano.;2
judwkc;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gcduvu5;rytiux;1605444131.0;That is a good point. My assumption is that simply sending the bitcoin from an unknown address would not be worth anything.

I think for the average person, storing on coin base may be the beat option.  That way your wallet is tied to your identity.  Your identity never changes, and you will always be able to get your bitcoin from coin base as long as they don’t try some massive exit scam, which seems extraordinarily unlikely.Also, if you die, who gets your hardware wallet?  Have you planned on how to handle that.  Your coin base assets won’t be lost when you die.  They might be held up for a while, but as long as your next of kin knows you have a coin base wallet, it will eventually get allocated appropriately.;15
jukivy;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gcdtu6o;dont-listentome;1605443583.0;The concept of offline storage in early usage of bitcoin referred to the notion of keeping the keys on a computer with no internet access.

However what I'm worried about is not the ""tainted"" coins, which can be in any number of wallets/addresses and CoinSwaped, but the tracking of owner of addresses themselves. It could be done in such a way, that the government issues everyone an official address, and the businesses/people are only allowed to accept payment from other official addresses. When receiving bitcoin from an unknown address you would have to explain who sent you those coins or not be able to spend them. Do you think this kind of tracking make sense and would be done? I think the governments would be quick to implement laws that require verification of which person the address belongs to that is sending the coins to you, ""for tracking identities of criminals"" or some other reason. And if you can't prove who the address belongs to then you can't spend them in any official way.

This could be compounded with more fiat on ramps in exchanges and trading pairs further lessening the overall %. Just because I think this might be an outcome of the future doesn’t mean it’ll come true of course, but it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be realistic about the tiny niche market that crypto still really is in relation to the entire global economy, and how much it will inevitably grow/change over the coming decades.;1

jugg4b;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gcddv2p;Chipjack;1605434741.0;There are three major problems with blockchain voting.Firstly, the network is a problem. A blockchain that runs on a network of government controlled nodes is just as trustworthy as a government controlled voting machine, and if someone controls a majority of the nodes, they can effectively control the election.The second problem is with voters themselves. Each citizen eligible to vote would need to be positively identified and allowed to create a public/private key-pair. If the government just assigned those keys, the system would be unreliable. The only copy of the private key must reside with the voter. And then they've got to take care of it, not lose it, not share it, and use it correctly when it's time to vote. They can't be allowed to vote more than once. Unless someone else got their key and voted for them, in which case you have to discard the old vote and accept a new one.The third is political. If requiring ID to vote is unfair to some voters and the Democrats can't accept that, surely requiring senior citizens to learn the basics of cryptography and data security is also unfair and the Republicans won't allow it.Essentially, this is a technologically perfect solution that becomes deeply flawed once you add people and society and politics into the mix.;8

I treat my bitcoin as two different things being the hot wallet and the cold storage.  I buy the bitcoin for commerce and use it for such.  When I buy bitcoin and am using it to buy goods, I don't need to declare it.  If that money sits in my hot wallet for any lenghth of time, I move it to cold storage.  All of the bitcoin that is in cold storage I will be expected to pay CGT on.  But of course, I'm going to want to make sure that that bitcoin in cold storage sits there for at least a year so that I can claim the [CGT 50% discount](https://www.ato.gov.au/general/capital-gains-tax/working-out-your-capital-gain-or-loss/working-out-your-capital-gain/the-discount-method-of-calculating-your-capital-gain/).I'm not even trying to be duplicitous about it.  I don't have problems paying the CGT on the money I earn, but it's really great not having to worry about bitcoin purchases that I make on a day-to-day basis.;1

jueq15;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gcd8yw8;Fak3Anon;1605432040.0;Price depends on supply & demand. If bitcoin cost of mining went to zero, supply would immediately skyrocket, crushing the price.

ju4pxr;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gcd8rlt;Cyborg_888;1605431947.0;Essentially yes. :-)5220 bitcoins are mined per day on average (6.25 x 6 x 24). In order to cover their costs the miners have to sell a large(ish) proportion of them, and the price is still going up.That means at least around $80 million is being added per day just to keep the price level. More if the price goes up.So around $1 billion is added to the market capitalisation every 12 days just to keep the price level at $16,000.;2

Gold was also very volatile, look at its price in 2002, volatilty to the upside in longer time frames doesn't hurt a store of value that much.>Bitcoin does have a limited supply. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. However, cryptocurrencies don’t have a limited supply. It is possible to create an infinite number of cryptocurrencies just like Bitcoin.

I dont think we need bitcoin to be a part of that but a blockchain based identity verification system where your verified Identity is used as an ID that allows you to place a vote on an election blockchain which corresponds with an oracle system using zero-knowledge proofs to check voter status/living condition data fed to them from government systems and live hospital records could be quite useful.;2
