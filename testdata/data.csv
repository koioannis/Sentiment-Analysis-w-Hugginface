jume6c;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gceufsd;warrchaser;1605465297.0;197 000 tonnes on earth.  What about elsewhere? Not saying it’s feasible to mine other planets, because it won’t be for a loooong time.;1
jmiko9;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gceuezb;andytoshi;1605465285.0;I don't think that you're computing the right probabilites, but to be honest, I don't have a good reason why. This seems like one of those situations where the choosing the right things to condition on is both subtle and critical.So rather than analyzing your reasoning, I just [implemented my program](https://gist.github.com/apoelstra/3c5957707bea4b0b00ddf2f8d7801395) to collide a variant of siphash from the Rust standard library. This is a 64 bit hash so naively ought to take 2^32 serial work. Instead I spawn 1024 threads and do it in a bit over 2^22 work.I think it's expected to work 1/e of the time, and indeed it seems to work every couple times that I try it (each attempt is ~90 seconds on my laptop).;1
jujcza;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gceuef8;LucSr;1605465276.0;For #2, people shall realize that the media-of-exchange is to protect the store-of-value ultimately.  If not, countries can force the custodial centralization and put insane capital gain tax on people to nullify the store-of-value purpose.&#x200BI think there is some conflict of interest for #2 because Fidelity, being a major financial institution, can enjoy the benefit of bitcoin already even bitcoin can be only used by central banks, major financial institutions, super wealthy guys ...etc.  Bitcoin would result in a bright future for countries who hate being bullied by USA's irresponsible USD but this does not necessarily mean a bright future for countries’ average citizens.;1

juq1k5;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gceuc3q;TheGreatMuffin;1605465242.0;">Bitcoin is a volunteer project those that contribute to the code can be easily compromised and intentionally push a bug that will undermine bitcoinI upvoted your post but this part is really misleading.  It's true that very few people (relatively to the world's population, or even the bitcoin space itself) understand the code deeply. However, it's not very easy to get any kind of malicious code into it, especially if it has the potential to cause really nasty (consensus) bugs.  Usually, every line of code is discussed, peer reviewed, tested and again reviewed, discussed and so on. So even if one or more developers were compromised, it wouldn't make it easy to inject malicious code into bitcoin. Keep in mind, the last major release of Bitcoin Core listed over 100 developers as contributors, so we're not really talking about ""few people"" here either. But even then, it's up to the individual user to decide of they want to run this code or not. So even if the majority of people probably run whatever code the Bitcoin Core repo publishes, there are also lots of critical eyes on it, and this serves as yet another layer of ""checks and balances"".  Here is a great article explaining how those checks and balances work: https://blog.lopp.net/who-controls-bitcoin-core-/";1
jume6c;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gceubc8;warrchaser;1605465231.0;Lol sorry man.  I did, but unfortunately didn’t dive deep enough to truly believe and put my money where my mouth is.  I was ignorant.;1
jughn6;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gceu84o;I_Do_Well;1605465185.0;Facebook has the disadvantage of most of their users being in the older demographic that doesn't understand or care about bitcoin and probably never will.;1

juo2fp;Bitcoin;2s3qj;gcetuv3;ThrowawayNumber2773;1605464995.0;"Nope, your observations are right. Ironically, current models that predict price just predict infinite price and justify this with ""the dollar will hyperinflate"" or ""the model will fail eventually"".Generally speaking, halvings have price impact because newly mined bitcoin represent the net money inflow (read net real world buying power) needed to enter the system to keep the current price. To what extent these newly mined bitcoin will influence the price in a far future due to their miniscule impact on the total supply is up to debate.";1
